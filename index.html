        Dudhsagar Falls literally translates to "sea of milk" owing to its milky
        white color. Amidst the <br />
        Mollem National Park or rather the Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary you will
        find the majestic <br />
        and stunningly flowing Dudhsagar Falls. <br />
        <br />
        A spectacular view for the domestic and foreign tourists is the Mandovi
        River spouting <br />
        down from the steep side of the mountain from over 1017 feet. The
        Mandovi River originates <br />
        on the Deccan Plateau in Karnataka and finds its way through the Western
        Ghats.
